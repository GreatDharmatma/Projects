This software is also referenced as 8085sim. 

FEATURES:
Supports all 8085 instructions and all interrupts.

Read the manual.pdf file for detailed instructions

What's missing? - This program donot support serial in/out feature. It was something which could be included easily. But I was sort of lazy :)
But its something which students dont use much - I haven't anyway!. So I suppose this would be okay. But if some one really need it, please try 
to contribute it. 

If you find any instruction not working as it is supposed to do, please contact me.
